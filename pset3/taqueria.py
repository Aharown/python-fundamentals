# One of the most popular places to eat in Harvard Square is Felipe’s Taqueria, which offers a menu of entrees, per the dict below,
# wherein the value of each key is a price in dollars:

# {
#     "Baja Taco": 4.25,
#     "Burrito": 7.50,
#     "Bowl": 8.50,
#     "Nachos": 11.00,
#     "Quesadilla": 8.50,
#     "Super Burrito": 8.50,
#     "Super Quesadilla": 9.50,
#     "Taco": 3.00,
#     "Tortilla Salad": 8.00
# }

# In a file called taqueria.py, implement a program that enables a user to place an order, prompting them for items, one per line,
# until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program).
# After each inputted item, display the total cost of all items inputted thus far, prefixed with a dollar sign ($)
# and formatted to two decimal places. Treat the user’s input case insensitively. Ignore any input that isn’t an item.
# Assume that every item on the menu will be titlecased.

#pseudocode
# may need while loop for reprompting user
# initialise running total var set to 0
# capture user input in item var (title())
# check item membership
# add price to running total
# print total with dollar sign prefixed
